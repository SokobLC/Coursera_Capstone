    "People who want to move to New York City always ask the same question. What neighborhood is best to live in New York City? My question back to them is what type of things you would like to see in your neighborhood? As everyone is different, I cannot say that one neighborhood is better than another because it depends on the individualâ€™s preference. For example, if you have a family with young kids, you would prefer to live near parks, schools, grocery stores, libraries, and so on. However, if you do not have kids, then maybe you might prefer to be closer to bars, clubs, restaurants, etc.\n",

    "This capstone project is to help people find the best neighborhood they want to live in New York City according to their own personal preferences. It will also help those who are visiting New York City to decide which neighborhood to stay and what area is more cost-effective. Also, people who are already living in New York City will benefit from this project as well because just because you live in the city that does not mean you know all the neighborhood and what kind of venues each neighborhood has to offer. The project will people explore the surrounding areas and see what kind of venues are there so they can make the best choice that best fits their needs. "
